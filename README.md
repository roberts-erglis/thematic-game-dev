# Thematic Game Development Seminar's Work - 2025

## How to launch/run game?

Requirement:
- Visual Studio Code
- VS Code plugin: Live Server

Download a zip file then extract it. Open extracted folder into Visual Studio Code's program.
If you had **Live Server** plugin is installed, then you should have a button at bottom-right of programm corner **"Go Live"**. Press it and it will open in your browser.
