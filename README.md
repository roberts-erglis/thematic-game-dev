# Thematic Game Development Seminar's Work - 2025

## How to launch/run game?

Requirement:
- Visual Studio Code
- VS Code plugin: Live Server

Download a zip file then extract it. Open extracted folder, select which project's folder file then open with Visual Studio Code.
If you had **Live Server** plugin installed, then you should have a button at bottom-right of program corner **"Go Live"**. Select index.html from tab view, press "Go Live" and it will open/run in your browser.

*Reminder: Opening **index.html** to browser directly will not work. In future will be added a single html page for full control of everything without needing VS Code.*
